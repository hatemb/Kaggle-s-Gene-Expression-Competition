Code of the Kaggle's in class competition https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/gene-expression-prediction 
The model is based on recurrent units (GRU) in 2 layers, each layer contain 360 units. Additional dense ReLu layer has been created to improve the results.
By calculating the mean of the prediction probabilities of this model and another one based on CNN, we obtained our best sumbission which was the 4th in the public leadeboard and the 5th in the privat one.
